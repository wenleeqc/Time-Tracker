# Time Tracker App

## Problem 
People have had difficulty being productive with online learning due to COVID-19. We believe that is because people cannot properly visualize how much time they have wasted on the web in a given day. For that reason, we wanted to create an application that visualizes a user's webtime usage.

## Solution
Converts browsing history in CSV format into a chart with Chartjs.

# How to use 
Run server:

- npm start in api folder

Run app:

- npm start root folder
